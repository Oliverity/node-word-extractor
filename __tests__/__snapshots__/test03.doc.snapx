While it's a favorite for those committed to the open source movement, many are shying away from it because of its viral nature which can potentially scare clients.\\\\tNot viral like it's GPL counterpart. Software can be dynamically linked to other LGPL licensed libraries without having to release your source code under LGPL. This license is generally used for software libraries with exception of programs such as Mozilla and Open Office. \\\\tThe BSD license is popular because of the flexibility it allows its licensees. There are really no limitations to what the licensee can do with the software other than the attribution requirements.\\\\tThis is becoming a very popular license because of the extreme simplicity of its text. The whole license is about half a page long and is very permissive like the BSD license.\\\\tThis license is somewhat similar to the BSD license, but goes into further detail in the attribution clauses and maintenance of intellectual property rights. Choosing this license over the BSD or MIT license is a matter of how specific you want your protections to be.\\\\t\\\\n\\\\n\\"",
